# Hallmarks of cancer search engine part 2

## Overview

This repo contains the work on a 4 part article series for building a rust-based search engine for cancer publications. It is meant to be a toy project and a way to show new developpers how focus and some good decisions can enable you to build something amazing quickly.

## This module

This repository contains code to analyze the output of the previous step, that will read the collected article data and attempt to build a keyword set from it which will then be used to compute keyword ratings. These serve as the main ingredient to rating any kind of text on how it relates to various field in cancer research.

## The project

The project is two-fold: To build a search engine for cancer publications and to write a series of useful tutorials about it.
The articles will be published on Medium.com, where a first article will introduce the project, a second one will introduce the parser that gets the data, the third one will document the creation of this module and the last one will cover building a web frontend for the output of this project.

## Next steps

The next step will be to use the keyword ratings in a web-frontend and to craft a good user experience around it.
